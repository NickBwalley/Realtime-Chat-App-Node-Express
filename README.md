# Realtime-Chat-App-Node-Express
Hello good people!. <br/>
Join me in building a Realtime chat application implementing socket.io, using NodeJs and ExpressJS only.<br/>
In addition, it allows users to choose in between different rooms and other functionalities put in place <br/>
We'll be implementing broadcast receivers and many other features to spice things up!. <br/>
Am really excited in building this mini-project module and add it to my repertoire. </br>
#Note.... 
There's still more to cover, you can build up on this CHATAPP and extra features! </br> 
In addition, you can connect to whichever DB you want, like MongoDB, MySQL, Cassandra, Postgresql or whichever database you prefer. 
## Without further ado,
### Let's dive into this everybody! (Allons-y tout le monde!) :wink:

# STEPS TO INSTALL AND RUN THIS APPLICATION. 
1. Clone this project on your remote computer. 
2. Open this project in whichever text editor, preferably VSCode. 
3. Open your terminal and type: **npm install** #This will download all the node modules that is needed to run this package. 
4. After it has finished downloading the node_modules, then still on your terminal type: **npm run dev** #This will now run your development server. 
5. Then now in your browser access: localhost:3000 to now load your landing page. 
6. Important notice: This project does not include a remote DB, it uses local storage which means when you refresh your browser, it looses your content. 
7. Assignment to you: Just try to use which ever method for connecting it to whichever DB you prefer as earlier on discussed above.
