# Realtime-Chat-App-Node-Express
Hello good people!. <br/>
Join me in building a Realtime chat application using socket.io, in NodeJs and ExpressJS only.<br/>
In addition, it allows users to choose in between different rooms and other functionalities put in place <br/>
We'll be implementing broadcast receivers and many other features to spice things up!. <br/>
Am really excited in building this mini-project module and add it to my repertoire. </br>
#Note.... 
There's still more to do, you can build up on this CHATAPP and extra features! </br> 
Like, connect to whichever DB you want. </br> maybe MongoDB, MySQL, Cassandra, Postgresql or whichever. 
## Without further ado, Let's dive into this everybody!...
## Allons-y tout le monde!...
