# Realtime-Chat-App-Node-Express
Hello good people!. <br/>
Join me in building a Realtime chat application implementing socket.io, using NodeJs and ExpressJS only.<br/>
In addition, it allows users to choose in between different rooms and other functionalities put in place <br/>
We'll be implementing broadcast receivers and many other features to spice things up!. <br/>
Am really excited in building this mini-project module and add it to my repertoire. </br>
#Note.... 
There's still more to cover, you can build up on this CHATAPP and extra features! </br> 
Like, connect to whichever DB you want, like MongoDB, MySQL, Cassandra, Postgresql or whichever database you prefer. 
## Without further ado,
### Let's dive into this everybody! (Allons-y tout le monde!) :wink:
